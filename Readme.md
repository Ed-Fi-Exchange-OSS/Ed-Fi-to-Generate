# Ed-Fi-to-Generate

The Ed-Fi Generate plug-in provides a standard means to transfer data from an
Ed-Fi ODS into the Generate CEDS Integrated Data Store (IDS). 

The plug-in consists of a set of standardized ETLs that agencies would use to
migrate data from an Ed-Fi ODS into CEDS IDS and into CEDS Reporting Data Store.

Ed-Fi Alliance tested the ETLs against the Ed-Fi Glendale Sample Database based
on v2x Data Standard.
