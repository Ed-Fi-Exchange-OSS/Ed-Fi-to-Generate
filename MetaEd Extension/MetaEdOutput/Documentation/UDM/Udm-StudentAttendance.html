<p>The Student Attendance domain represents both daily and classperiod (section) attendance. This model supports two approaches for collecting attendance data:</p>
<ul>
<li>One attendance event for each student-section (or each student-day), reporting both attendance and absences</li>
<li>&quot;Exception only&quot; reporting, providing attendance events only for absences and tardies</li>
</ul>
