<p>The Enrollment domain represents students&#39; enrollments in schools, as specifically designated by the StudentSchoolAssociation. The model supports the two cases of where a student is limited to be enrolled only in one school at a time or cases where a state may have policies supporting multiple school enrollments. The semantics assume that a separate StudentSchoolAssociation is provided for each grade level for each student; in other words, a student is withdrawn in the previous grade level and enrolled in the next grade level when promoted.<br>For associations between a student and a school or LEA that is <em>not</em> enrollment(e.g., school of accountability), the StudentEducationOrganizationAssociation is defined.</p>
