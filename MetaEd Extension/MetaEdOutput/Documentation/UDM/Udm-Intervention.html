<li>InterventionPrescription describes an activity intended to address a specific problem or diagnosis. It identifies the kinds of students targeted and how the intervention should be delivered.</li>
<li>Intervention is a specific implementation of an instructional approach, outlined in an InterventionPrescription, with one or more students in a Cohort. Interventions may be one-time actions or recurring actions overtime. Interventions typically have assigned Staff. AttendanceEvents may be captured for Interventions.</li>
<li>EducationContent metadata may be linked to InterventionPrescriptionsand/or Interventions. The EducationContent includes descriptive information about the content conforming to the Learning Resource MetadataInitiative (LRMI).</li>
<li>StudentInterventionAssociation links Students to Interventions in which they participate. The effectiveness of an Intervention for a given Student is also captured. Data about a formal InterventionStudy for an InterventionPrescription may also be associated.</li>
