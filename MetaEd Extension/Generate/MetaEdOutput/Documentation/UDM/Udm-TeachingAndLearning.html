<p>The Teaching and Learning domain represents the followingconcepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course catalog, representing the course definitions and course offerings available at a school in each session</li>
<li>The student&#39;s class enrollments in sections and the teacher(s) assigned to that section</li>
<li>Early childhood enrollments in programs and the staff members related to that program</li>
</ul>
<p>The model is based upon multiple levels of definition, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Course entity represents the definition of the course, its characteristics, and its mapping to LearningStandards orLearningObjectives. A course may be defined a state, LEA or schoollevel.</li>
<li>The CourseOffering entity represents a course that is offered by a school during a session. The CourseOffering will have a LocalCourseCode and may have a LocalCourseTitle.</li>
<li>A school will have one or more sections for each CourseOffering. Students are enrolled in specific sections. Each Section entity will have one or more assigned staff, will typically meet in a specific location in the school, and will be assigned a ClassPeriodentity for the session. Since early learning teaching and learning is based on programs, students are enrolled by association to the Program and Staff entities as well.</li>
</ul>
